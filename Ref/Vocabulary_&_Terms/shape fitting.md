shape fitting - adjusting a mathematical model or geometric shape to match a set of data points as close a possible
  * ex:
    * input - set of points or data in 2D or 3D (lidar scan).
    * processing - mathematical model (line, circle, curve, etc.) is created and adjusted to the data to fit it.
    * output - fitted shape that best represents the underlying data
  * use cases:
    * object boundary detection
    * path and obstacle modeling
    * etc.
