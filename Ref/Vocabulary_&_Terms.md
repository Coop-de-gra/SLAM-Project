### Why
There are simply some things I haven't heard of and this is a place to collect them and define them

---

semantic segmentation - computer vision task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category
  * ex:
    * input - a street scene.
    * output - "car", "road", "person"
  * use cases:
    * autonomous driving
    * satelite image analysis
    * medical imaging
    * etc.

---

shape fitting - adjusting a mathematical model or geometric shape to match a set of data points as close a possible
  * ex:
    * input - set of points or data in 2D or 3D (lidar scan).
    * processing - mathematical model (line, circle, curve, etc.) is created and adjusted to the data to fit it.
    * output - fitted shape that best represents the underlying data
  * use cases:
    * object boundary detection
    * path and obstacle modeling
    * etc.
