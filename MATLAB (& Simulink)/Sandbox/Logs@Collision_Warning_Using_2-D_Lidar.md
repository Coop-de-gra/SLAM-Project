[Collision Warning Using 2-D Lidar](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2024b/lidar/ug/collision-warning-using-2d-lidar.html)<p>

okay so before we start, a little new thing I learned<p>
In MATLAB: Add-Ons > Manage Add-Ons > Toolbox > (3-dots to the right) > View in... Explorer > Examples<p>
and on the right side, there is a whole entire log of examples AND THEY ARE CATEGORIZED<p>
ex. Getting Started, I/O, PreProcessing, Labeling Segmentation & Detection, Detection and Tracking, Calibration and Sensor Fusion, Navigation and Mapping<p>
like what! this is everything I need and exactly what I was touching on at the end of my last [log](https://github.com/Coop-de-gra/SLAM-Project/blob/2258c9603e8a6871cad05ce08ceb69c0f7c05d5d/MATLAB%20(%26%20Simulink)/Sandbox/Logs%40Lidar_Toolbox_GettingStarted.md)
